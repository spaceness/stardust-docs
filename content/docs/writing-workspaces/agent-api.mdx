description: Container agent API and implementation details

The container agent is an HTTP server that is also used to keep the docker container alive, normally at the end of a Docker start script. These docs are for developers looking to write their own versions of the agent, or to understand how the stock agent works.

The agent has a few endpoints that are used by Stardust to interact with the container. The agent is expected to be running on port 6080.

## General

### `GET /`

This endpoint returns a test page to check if the agent is running.

### `GET /healthcheck`

This endpoint returns an object with the `message` key if the agent is running. Used to [check if the container is running](https://github.com/spaceness/stardust/blob/main/src/lib/session/session-running.ts).

```json title="Example response"
{ "message": "Stardust Container Agent is running" }
```

### `GET /password`

This endpoint returns the VNC password for the container as a string. [Used in `/api/session/[id]` in Stardust](https://github.com/spaceness/stardust/blob/main/src/app/api/session/%5Bslug%5D/route.ts).

```ts
await fetch(`http://${containerSession.ip}:6080/password`).then((res) =>
  res.text()
);
```

### `GET /screenshot`

This endpoint returns a screenshot of the container's desktop as a PNG image.[Used in `/api/session/[id]/preview` in Stardust](https://github.com/spaceness/stardust/blob/main/src/app/api/session/%5Bslug%5D/preview/route.ts).

## Files

All are used in [`/api/session/[id]/files`](https://github.com/spaceness/stardust/blob/main/src/app/api/session/%5Bslug%5D/files/route.ts) in Stardust.

### `GET /files/list`

This endpoint returns a list of files in the container's `~/Downloads` directory as an array of strings.

### `GET /files/download/:name`

This endpoint returns the file in the container's `~/Downloads` directory with the name `:name`.

### `PUT /files/upload/:name`

This endpoint uploads a file to the container's `~/Uploads` directory with the name `:name`. The file should be sent as a `NodeJS.Buffer` in the body of the request.

```ts
await fetch(`http://${ip}:6080/files/upload/${fileName}`, {
  method: "PUT",
  body: Buffer.from(buffer),
});
```
