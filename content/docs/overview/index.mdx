You may think this is any ordinary clipboard;however, it has a unique feature which auto syncs the clipboard attached to your device and doesn't need to be pasted every time.
However, it doesn't copy images or files and for that it will be explained in a bit.

Here, you can upload files from Stardust into your personal computer by downloading it to Stardust's Cloud and going to the side-bar and clicking download files and select the one you want!
