There are special considerations to take into account when running Stardust in production. This guide will help you understand the best practices for running Stardust in production.

## Process manager

It is recommended to use a process manager to run Stardust in production. You can use something like `pm2` or just a systemd service. This will ensure that Stardust is always running and will automatically restart if it crashes.

### pm2

To use `pm2`, first install it globally:

```bash
pnpm i -g pm2
```

Then start Stardust with `pm2`. You can prepend the port env before the command:

```bash
pm2 start "pnpm start" --name stardust
```

### systemd

To use systemd, create a service file at `/etc/systemd/system/stardust.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Stardust SystemD service
# If postgres is running as a service as well as docker
After=docker.service postgresql.service
[Service]
# Where GitHub repository is cloned
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/stardust
DynamicUser=yes
NoNewPrivileges=yes
# might be different, run `which pnpm`
ExecStart=/usr/bin/pnpm start
# Useful for docker installations
ExecStartPre=docker start stardust-postgres
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
# pnpm install directory might make you set the user to root
User=root
# Use for setting runtime env such as port
Environment="PORT=8090"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After this, add this to the `.gitconfig` of the user the service is running as:

```ini
[safe]
	directory = /home/ubuntu/stardust
```

Then reload the systemd daemon and start and enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable stardust
sudo systemctl start stardust
```
