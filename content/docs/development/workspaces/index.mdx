Stardust workspaces are the base of a session. They are Docker images with a base OS, such as Debian installed, with a VNC server, PulseAudio TCP server, and a lightweight file server.

# Structure
The container has a user named `stardust` with no set password. These folders exist:
- `/home/stardust` - The home directory of the `stardust` user.
- `/home/stardust/Downloads` - The downloads of the `stardust` user.
- `/home/stardust/Uploads` - The uploads of the `stardust` user.
## VNC server
The VNC server is used to display the desktop of the workspace. Stardust's stock images use TigerVNC, as it has the best support for noVNC, which is used in Stardust.

It runs on port `5901`.

## PulseAudio TCP Server
The PulseAudio TCP server is used to stream audio from the workspace to the client. It is using a modified C server from [here](https://coredump.ws/index.php?dir=code&post=NoVNC_with_audio).

Source code: [spaceness/stardust#main/workspaces/scripts/tcpulse.c](https://github.com/spaceness/stardust/blob/rewrite/workspaces/scripts/tcpulse.c)

It runs on port `4713`.

## File Server
The file server is used to transfer files between the workspace and the client. It is a lightweight NodeJS server.

Source code: [spaceness/stardust#main/workspaces/scripts/files.mjs](https://github.com/spaceness/stardust/blob/rewrite/workspaces/scripts/files.mjs)

It runs on port `6080`.
