## Obtaining the latest release

Head to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/spaceness/stardust) and download the latest source code archive in the format of your choice implying you can extract it, [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) is a good utility for this.

## Enter the workspaces folder

As of the current release, just `cd` into `workspaces` if your current working directory is Stardust's extracted source code, if not first `cd` into Stardust.

## Run the build script

To build the project, run `pnpm build` within the `workspaces` directory!

(No way to build a project, you run a build script??? ðŸ¤¯)

### CLI flags

- `--images`
    - Specify the images to be built in a comma separated list with no spaces.
    - e.g. `--images chromium,firefox`
- `--multi-platform`
    - Builds the workspaces for both ARM and 64-bit CPUs.
- `--push`
    - Pushes the image to the Docker registry. This only exists for our GitHub workflow and serves no purpose to external developers unless the build script is modified.
- `--quiet`
    - Suppresses Docker build logs within the console.
