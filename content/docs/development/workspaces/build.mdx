## Obtaining the latest release

Head to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/spaceness/stardust) and download the latest source code archive in the format of your choice implying you can extract it, [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) is a good utility for this.

## Enter the workspaces folder

As of the current release, just `cd` into `workspaces` if your current working directory is Stardust's extracted source code, if not first `cd` into Stardust.

## Run the build script

To build the project, run `pnpm build` within the `workspaces` directory!

(No way to build a project, you run a build script??? ðŸ¤¯)
