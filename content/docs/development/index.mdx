## Structure

Stardust is split into 2 main components:

- Web: The Stardust UI and backend server. This is the main interface for interacting with Stardust.
- Daemon (`stardustd`): Runs on each individual Stardust node. It is responsible for managing the sessions and workspaces.

Stardust Web sends HTTP requests to the Daemon, which then interacts with Docker to create and manage the workspaces. The daemon api schema can be accessed at `http://<daemon-host>/swagger`, or going to `http://<app-host>/daemon-api/<node-id>` on a Stardust Web instance with the node added. This will require admin access.
